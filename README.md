# Chef-Up
An application made for the SAS Catalyst project that contains easy, healthy recipes for college students. All recipes were created by Christina Yoh.
The application runs on iOS devices. 
To use the application, first open it. From there, you will begin at the home page, where you can navigate to the meal of choice, a nutrition guide, or 
a brief explination behind the purpose of the project.
